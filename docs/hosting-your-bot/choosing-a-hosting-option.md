# Chose a hosting option

Some places where you can host your bot.

## Free options

These are some places where you can host your bot form free.

### A raspberry PI

You can host your bot in a Raspberry Pi, this is nice option if you have one laying around. As the bot doesn't need any open ports hosting it in a Raspberry Pi should be a very straightforward and secure process.

### Railway

[Railway](https://railway.app/) is a very simple hosting platform that gives us a good 500 hours of free hosting every month. This means that the bot will only be online for approximately 20 days. That's not so good but is a very viable option for hosting your bot for free.

## Paid options

These are some known hosting options where you can host your bot as a docker container.

- [OVH](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en/vps/)
- [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/)
- [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2)

:::tip Personal recommendation
I recommend using the railway if you only want to test the bot. If you want to use it in production I advise you to host it on a Raspberry PI or use some paid hosting option.
