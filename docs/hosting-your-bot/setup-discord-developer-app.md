# Setup discord developer app

You need to create a new app in the discord developer portal for the bot to work.
You can do this [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications/)

## Steps

* Create a new app
* Get the App ID and save it
* Create a new bot inside this app
* Get the token and save it

Don't close this page as you will need to invite the bot once you have finished the hosting process.
